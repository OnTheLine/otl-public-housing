TOTAL JACK,,,324,4404,7%,,,"In Hartford-area federally-funded defense housing, only 324 out of 4400 units (7 percent) were intended for or occupied by Black residents in 1944. But about half of these (156 units) were located in one project, Nelton Court, an all-Black project. Many other sites in Hartford had far fewer Black residents, such as Charter Oak Terrace housing project with only 2 Black units out of 1000. (0.2%). In suburban towns, federal projects often had 1 or fewer Black units."
