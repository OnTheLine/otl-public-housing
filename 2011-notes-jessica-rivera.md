# Public Housing in Hartford Since 1940
notes by Jessica Rivera for CT Fair Housing Center, Nov 2011

One of my legal interns (who happens to have majored in History in undergrad), Jessica Rivera, has pulled together the attached notes from her research on public housing developments in Hartford gathered from the Hartford Public Library.  My goal here is to try to figure out when public housing in the Hartford area was built and the racial composition of the residents.  In a perfect world we would be able to convert this into an interactive map that could show over time how family public housing was almost exclusively built in Hartford and populated by people of color.  I recognize that it won’t be as simple as that (already our research as shown how WWII veterans’ housing was a big part of the equation), but  I am hoping we can get something useful out of the research.  It might also be interested to look into efforts to build elderly housing in the suburbs.
I wanted to share this with you for a couple of reasons.  First, to the extent it is helpful to your research (even in this early semi-draft form), you are welcome to it.  Second, if you would like to collaborate on this, for example if you had an undergrad intern who wanted to work with Jess, that would be great.  Third, we would welcome any advice on methodology (for example – Jess has not made copies of these reports, but obviously they would be good to have).
Jess is now going through some of the Sheff Housing boxes to see if she can connect the information she has found to anything in there.
Any involvement is welcome and we are happy to share any results with you.

Hi Erin,

I have attached my notes from my research so far. Is this information helpful, or am I missing some key information?
