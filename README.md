## Methods and File Structure
1. Obtain map images: download large JPG2000 from LOC, convert to JPG; or download JPG/PNG from other sources
2. Georeference image in https://mapwarper.net at default WGS84, export GeoTIFF for long-term preservation, delete item in Mapwarper
3. Add one or multiple GeoTIFFs as raster layer in QGIS. Keep QGIS Projection EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
4. QGIS Processing > Raster Tools to generate XYZ tiles into `tiles` folder
5. Host folder and Leaflet code in repo using GitHub Pages, or choose another server. see Leaflet code in `index.html` or use either URL to this map tile layer on GitHub:
