Leaflet interactive historical map of public housing projects in metro Hartford CT

## Tile layer hosted using GitHub Pages on this repo
- live map https://ontheline.github.io/otl-public-housing/index.html
- storymap TO COME

## Data tables
- 1940s-public-housing-projects-race-hartford-county-ct.csv
- focus on WWII-era projects, with partial data on post-war projects
- 1940-census-pre-bellevue-square.csv, to compare racial composition of neighborhood before and after construction of racially segregated public housing project

## Map Georeference methods
1. Obtain map images: download large JPG2000 from LOC, convert to JPG; or download JPG/PNG from other sources. Note that some PNGs from ProQuest Digital Sanborn may need to be converted into a simpler format (JPG?). See Mapwarper warning: "My greyscale image won't work: Try to convert to RGB/Truecolor first and then upload. Often it seems as if images with just one or two bands cause issues"
2. Georeference image in https://mapwarper.net at default WGS84 (because it's easier than QGIS Georeferencer)
3. Export uncropped GeoTIFF for long-term preservation
4. Crop in Mapwarper to focus on public housing project, export cropped GeoTIFF
5. Delete Mapwarper entry (to avoid using it for long-term preservation)
6. Add one or multiple GeoTIFFs as raster layer in QGIS. Keep QGIS Projection EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
7. QGIS Processing > Raster Tools to generate XYZ tiles into `tiles` folder. Be sure to *scroll all the way down* in the QGIS window to designate output folder.
8. Host folder and Leaflet code in repo using GitHub Pages, or choose another server.
9. In the `index.html` file in this repo, see how Leaflet code calls this tile layer URL:
  - https://ontheline.github.io/otl-public-housing/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
  - Alternative URL to repo without using GitHub Pages:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnTheLine/otl-public-housing/main/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

## Map Sources
Beginning in the 1920s, Sanborn insurance maps were designed to be continuously updated with tissue-paper correction clips that users would paste over existing pages to display changes over time, such as property demolition or new construction. See explanation from Library of Congress: https://guides.loc.gov/fire-insurance-maps/sanborn-interpreting. See example of how Oakwood Acres public housing project in West Hartford appeared on the 1950 map (left) but was torn down in 1954 and removed from the 1961 map (right).

![1950-61 Oakwood Acres comparison](screenshot-1950-1961-sanborn-oakwoodacres.png)

Since Sanborn maps held by libraries reflect different time periods, depending on how long they added correction slips, see date ranges (e.g. 1922-1950 vs. 1922-1961) in the publication years for items below.

US Library of Congress, “Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps Online Checklist,” https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn/.

- Hartford volume 1, 1922-1950 https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn01132_009/
- Hartford volume 2, 1922-1950 https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn01132_010/ (not available online, July 2021).
- Hartford volume 3, 1923-1950 https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn01132_011/
- Hartford volume 4, 1923-1950 https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn01132_012/ (not available online, July 2021).

In July 2021, a Geography & Map Division librarian at LOC kindly forwarded my request to make volumes 2 and 4 available online, since they have the same publication dates as volumes 1 and 3. But the librarian and I were perplexed that the Digital Scanning Team at LOC replied that volumes 2 and 4 had not received copyright clearance and would not be shared online in the near future.

Connecticut State Library allowed me to take digital photos of their Sanborn maps, which I hosted on GitHub:

Sanborn Map Company, Insurance Maps of Hartford Connecticut (New York: Sanborn Map Co, 1922-1961), https://cscu-csl-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/1aj269h/01CSCU_NETWORK_ALMA7176213960003451.

CT State Library also provides online access (requires CT State library ID card number) to this extension collection of black and white digital Sanborn maps for many cities and towns across Connecticut. Downloaded here for "non-commercial, non-legal use" in an open-access, educational public history website:

- Manchester, 1926-1949
- New Britain, 1909-1950

Also, I have requested low-resolution digital images from Sanborn maps held by UConn Archives & Special Collections.

- Digital copy sent by EHPL, includes several housing project planning maps, most likely from the East Hartford Housing Authority files.

US Geological Survey, TopoView map viewer, https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/. Downloaded high-resolution brown-colored maps in GeoTIFF format, uploaded to QGIS, transformed to WGS84 format, clipped to map extent, and resaved as smaller georectified .tif files.
