## Problems with AllMaps testing as of June 2021
-  for multi-page IIIF images (such as Sanborn map book pages in the LOC collection), the tool currently leaves in place georeference points from prior pages. In other words, points 1-7 from map page 46 are *still* in the same spot when I try to georeference map page 47. Developer needs to find a way to treat pages from the same IIIF manifest as separate images.
- also frustrating that once you’ve placed a georeference marker on the screen, there is no way that I can find to delete it.

### Add Library of Congress items IIIF manifest link to Editor
